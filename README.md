# Software Tag Recommender
This repository contains all our exploration on the use of machine learning methods to automatically recommend topics (tags) for software repositories.

It currently is organized as following:
<ul>
  <li><p><code>data-preparation</code>: Our scripts for pre-processing the data, the data containing rules for preprocessing tags and generating sub-topics. 
 Also, we include the final dataset of preprocessed sub-topics along with their featured Github topics and set of aliases.</p></li>
  <li><p><code>machine-learning</code>: Our python scripts for training various machine-learning-based algorithms for recommending topics.</p></li>
</ul>
