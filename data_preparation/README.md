# Data preparation scripts and files
The Jupyter notebook `topic_preprocess.ipynb` applies the rules for preprocessing tags. 
These rules can be found in the `rules` folder.
the file `subtopics_dataset.csv` contains the final data of featured tags, aliases and our sub-topics.
We provide 29K unique sub-topics for the set of featured tags of Github. 
We were able to cover 16K repositories with these sub-topics.
